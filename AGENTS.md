# AGENTS

Repository overview for automated agents and contributors.

## Summary

`rn-playwright-driver` is a Playwright-compatible E2E test driver for React Native apps. The driver runs in Node.js and connects to the app's Hermes runtime via CDP.

## Key directories

- `packages/driver` - Driver, CDP client, harness, and Playwright fixtures
- `packages/view-tree` - Native view tree module (Expo Modules API)
- `packages/screenshot` - Native screenshot module (Expo Modules API)
- `packages/lifecycle` - Native lifecycle module (Expo Modules API)
- `example` - Expo app and E2E tests
- `docs/NATIVE-MODULES-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture reference

## Read-first files

- `README.md`
- `docs/NATIVE-MODULES-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `packages/driver/src/types.ts`
- `packages/driver/harness/index.ts`

## Commands

```bash
bun install
bun run check

# E2E (requires Metro + device/simulator)
cd example
bun run test:e2e
```

## Constraints

- Hermes CDP is required; Metro `/json` must be reachable.
- The harness must be imported in the app: `@0xbigboss/rn-playwright-driver/harness`.
- Native modules live in the app; the driver package contains no native code.
