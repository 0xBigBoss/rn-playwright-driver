# rn-playwright-driver

Playwright-compatible E2E test driver for React Native using Hermes CDP. It runs in Node.js, connects to the app’s Hermes runtime via Metro’s debug endpoint, and drives your app through a JS harness plus optional native modules.

## What this provides

- **Device API**: `evaluate`, `waitForFunction`, `pointer`, `screenshot`, `openURL`, etc.
- **Locators**: `getByTestId`, `getByText`, `getByRole` (requires view-tree module).
- **Core Primitives**: `getWindowMetrics`, `waitForRaf`, `getFrameCount`, pointer paths, event tracing.
- **JS Harness**: `global.__RN_DRIVER__` installed in the app to bridge driver calls.
- **Native Modules (optional)**:
  - View tree queries
  - Screenshots
  - Lifecycle controls

## Packages

| Package | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `@0xbigboss/rn-playwright-driver` | Driver + Playwright fixtures + harness |
| `@0xbigboss/rn-driver-view-tree` | View tree queries (locators, bounds, visibility) |
| `@0xbigboss/rn-driver-screenshot` | Screen/region capture |
| `@0xbigboss/rn-driver-lifecycle` | App lifecycle helpers |

## Requirements

- Node.js **>= 18**
- React Native app running **Hermes** with Metro debug endpoints enabled
- Expo Modules API for native modules (iOS + Android)

## Installation

Install driver and native modules in your app:

```bash
bun add @0xbigboss/rn-playwright-driver \
  @0xbigboss/rn-driver-view-tree \
  @0xbigboss/rn-driver-screenshot \
  @0xbigboss/rn-driver-lifecycle
```

Install Playwright in your test workspace:

```bash
bun add -d @playwright/test
```

## App Setup (Harness)

Import the harness once in your app entry:

```ts
import "@0xbigboss/rn-playwright-driver/harness";
```

Then build/run the app so the native modules are installed:

```bash
expo run:ios
# or
expo run:android
```

## Production-safe Setup (Required)

Do **not** ship the harness in production builds. Use one of these patterns so it only loads for E2E/dev:

### Option A: Dev-only entry (recommended)

Use the `/harness/dev` entry point which only installs when `__DEV__` is true or `globalThis.__E2E__` is set:

```ts
// In your app entry (e.g., App.tsx or index.ts)
import "@0xbigboss/rn-playwright-driver/harness/dev";
```

To enable in production E2E builds, set the flag before the import:

```ts
// Set before import for prod E2E testing
globalThis.__E2E__ = true;
import "@0xbigboss/rn-playwright-driver/harness/dev";
```

### Option B: Conditional import (explicit)

```ts
if (__DEV__ || globalThis.__E2E__ === true) {
  void import("@0xbigboss/rn-playwright-driver/harness");
}
```

### Option C: Separate entry file (cleanest for CI)

```ts
// index.e2e.ts
import "./index";
import "@0xbigboss/rn-playwright-driver/harness";
```

Point your E2E build/profile at `index.e2e.ts` so production builds never include the harness.

## Writing Tests

Use the provided Playwright fixtures:

```ts
import { test, expect } from "@0xbigboss/rn-playwright-driver/test";

test("can evaluate JS", async ({ device }) => {
  const result = await device.evaluate<number>("1 + 2 + 3");
  expect(result).toBe(6);
});

test("can tap by testID", async ({ device }) => {
  await device.getByTestId("increment-button").tap();
});
```

## Configuration

Environment variables for target selection and timeouts:

| Env var | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RN_METRO_URL` | Metro bundler URL | `http://localhost:8081` |
| `RN_DEVICE_ID` | Device ID to match | _unset_ |
| `RN_DEVICE_NAME` | Device name substring match | _unset_ |
| `RN_TIMEOUT` | Request timeout (ms) | `30000` |

## Running E2E Tests

1. Start Metro for the app (e.g., `expo start`).
2. Run the app on device/simulator with Hermes debugging enabled.
3. Run Playwright:

```bash
bun run test:e2e
```

## Development (Monorepo)

```bash
bun install
bun run check
```

Useful scripts (root):
- `bun run build` – build all packages
- `bun run lint` / `bun run typecheck` – quality checks
- `bun run check` – typecheck + lint + knip + cpd

## Development Notes

- `expo run:ios --device "Device Name"` performs a full native build and then starts Metro as a long-running file watcher. Run E2E tests in a separate terminal while Metro is running.

## Architecture

High-level flow:

```
Playwright test (Node)
  └─ @0xbigboss/rn-playwright-driver (CDP client)
       └─ Hermes Runtime via Metro /json
            └─ global.__RN_DRIVER__ harness
                 └─ Expo native modules (view-tree, screenshot, lifecycle)
```

See `docs/NATIVE-MODULES-ARCHITECTURE.md` for full details.
